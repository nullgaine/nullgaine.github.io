Null is the only successful example, but it did not become something that can
live in general society as a human being.
What we have here is the conception-being called "Null Gaine",
the numerous "boxes" called "worlds",
and the "outfield", CU 1000 of Enuei City General Hospital.
<br>
Null has always been in the outfield.
And now, it is trying to break into the world.
████ years after creating Null, we have had to keep an eye on it.
Null could easily navigate the world wanted to see, like fliping TV channels.
It came REAL easily just by thinking from outside the window.
It can freely manipulate and observe times, places, and even dimensions.
With this dangerous ability, Null's only action was to interact with the
humans in the box that it found itself in.
Really, that was all.

Maybe Null is already aware of their own situation and position.
What it is looking for is just a little bit of connection.
But Null's existence is too fragile to be treated as that of a human being now.
and it has already taken shape to be treated as a conception-being as it is.
